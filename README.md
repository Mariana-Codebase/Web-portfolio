# Mariana Dev Portfolio

A clean neo‑brutalist portfolio with a 3D background, terminal mode, bilingual content, and GitHub‑synced projects. The projects section is powered by my own API, which enriches repositories with categories and language breakdowns.

## Highlights

- Minimalist UI with bold typography and subtle motion.
- 3D starfield background with Three.js.
- ES/EN content from a single data file.
- Projects fed by a custom GitHub API with language percentages.
- Vercel‑friendly build and deploy setup.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite
- Three.js + React Three Fiber

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the dev server.

## Docs

Full documentation lives in `docs/README.md`.

## GitHub Category Marker

Add a category marker in a repo README to classify GitHub projects:

```
//WEB
```

The marker must be on the first line, start with `//`, and the value after `//` is used as the category.
